  h3 The SQL DELETE Statement
  
  p The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
  h3 DELETE Syntax
  p #[span(style='color: blue') DELETE FROM] table_name #[span(style='color: blue') WHERE] condition;
  h3 SQL DELETE Example
  p The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:
  p #[span(style='color: blue') DELETE FROM] Customers #[span(style='color: blue') WHERE] CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
  p #[span(style='font-weight: bold') Note:] #[span(style='color: red') Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!]
